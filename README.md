# Engagelytics 

## Overview
This project leverages the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) tech stack for building a dynamic and user-friendly website. The backend integrates a powerful AI model created using Langflow, trained on a synthetic dataset, to deliver advanced insights and functionalities.

## Features
- **Website Development**: Built using the MERN stack for scalability and responsiveness.
- **AI Integration**: Utilizes a Langflow-generated model for intelligent interactions and insights.
- **Synthetic Dataset**: Trained on a custom dataset designed for optimal performance and edge-case handling.
- **Post Classification**: Classifies content based on predefined types.
- **Interactive Insights**: Provides actionable insights for influencers, social media managers, and content creators.

## Tech Stack
### Frontend
- **React.js**: For building an interactive and responsive user interface.
- **CSS Framework**: Styled with modern design principles.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: For server-side logic and API development.
- **Express.js**: As the web application framework.
- **MongoDB**: For a flexible and scalable database solution.

### AI Model
- **Langflow**: Used for creating and fine-tuning the AI model.
- **Python**: For synthetic data generation and preprocessing.
  
## Deployment Link

   npm start
   ```

## Usage
- Access the website at `http://localhost:3000`.
- Explore the features, interact with the AI-powered functionalities, and view insights.

## Challenges Faced
- **Data Integration**: Resolved format mismatches between Python and MERN stack using middleware.
- **Performance Optimization**: Improved response times with caching and cloud deployment.
- **Model Accuracy**: Enhanced classification by augmenting the dataset and retraining the model.

## Future Enhancements
- Adding more customizable insights.
- Expanding dataset for diverse use cases.
- Optimizing AI model performance further.
